#Welcome
These are just Project Euler solutions done in C++. 

A lot of the ones that aren't listed were done by hand.

Some of these have the answers in the comments, others do not. Likewise, some of these have the actual question in the comments, however as the questions got longer, I stopped doing so due to a large comment size.
